# CoupleFinPlan
comprehensive financial planner for two people

Budgeting Methodology Options
The application incorporates four primary budgeting methods that couples commonly use . The 50/30/20 rule allocates 50% of income to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings and debt repayment, providing a simple framework for couples with stable incomes

Expense Splitting Strategies
One of the most critical aspects of couple budgeting is determining how to fairly divide shared expenses . The application provides multiple approaches to ensure both partners feel the arrangement is equitable and sustainable .

Methods for Dividing Costs
The 50/50 split method requires each partner to pay exactly half of all shared expenses, making it simple to calculate and implement . However, this approach may not be fair when partners have significantly different incomes . Proportional splitting based on income percentages ensures that each partner contributes according to their earning capacity, making it more equitable for couples with income disparities .

The budget planner includes comprehensive goal-setting features to help couples identify, prioritize, and track progress toward their shared objectives .

Priority-Based Goal Framework
Financial goals should be categorized by priority level to ensure couples focus their resources on the most critical objectives first . High-priority goals include building an emergency fund covering three to six months of expenses, paying off high-interest debt, and establishing consistent retirement savings .

Medium-priority goals encompass major purchases like home down payments, vehicle purchases, and children's education planning . Lower-priority goals include vacation funds and discretionary savings that enhance quality of life but don't compromise financial security

Debt Management Strategies
The application includes specialized tools for debt payoff planning, incorporating both the debt snowball and debt avalanche methods . The debt snowball approach focuses on paying off the smallest balances first to build momentum and maintain motivation, while the debt avalanche method prioritizes highest interest rates to minimize total interest paid

Budget Categories and Expense Planning
Effective budgeting requires comprehensive categorization of expenses to ensure no financial obligations are overlooked . The budget planner organizes expenses into logical groupings that reflect typical couple spending patterns and facilitate accurate tracking .
